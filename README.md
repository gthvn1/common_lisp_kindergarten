## Let's play

As said in the overview we will start by following the book "Practical
Common Lisp".

### Chapter1: Why LISP?

- anwser seems obvious... just want to have fun.

### Chapter2: Lather, Rinse, Repeat: A Tour of the REPL

- We build emacs-28.1
- We installed *sbcl*
- We installed sly from mepa
  - we installed quicklisp
- We are able to start REPL :-)
- We did the hello world in sly
  - then copy/paste it in hello.lisp
    - `C-c C-c` compile it in REPL
    - `C-c C-z` open the REPL with newly evaluated stuff... so cool...

### Chapter3: Practical: A Simple Database

- Learn *plist*
  - list with keywords in it
  - `getf` to get the element
- Add cd into the DB
- Prompt inputs from user
- TODO: Open & Save the DB

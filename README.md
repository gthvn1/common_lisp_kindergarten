## Let's play
- We build emacs-28.1
- We installed *sbcl*
- We installed sly from mepa
  - we installed quicklisp
- We are able to start REPL :-)
- We did the hello world in sly
  - then copy/paste it in hello.lisp
    - C-c C-c compile it in REPL
    - C-c C-z open the REPL with newly evaluated stuff... so cool...
